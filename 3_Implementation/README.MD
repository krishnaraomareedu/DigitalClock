》This project can be executed using two  ways if you are not familiar with codeblocks then use dev c++:

☐  Using CodeBlocks:

1.This project contains graphics header files .so,inorder to executes this files u must have to jump back to the previous versions of codeblocks

2.you have to be sure that  you are using the     version of 17.__ of codeblocks because in the updated version the graphics are not working

3.When You installed the 17. version of Codeblocks then you need to change some settings and upload some 'winBGIm' files to the existing files .

4.And then,Save your C coded files with " .cpp" extension . so,it is little bit difficult to explain and for you to understand
