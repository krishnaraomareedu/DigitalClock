# Problem Statement:
              
  The purpose of this project is to generate Time and Date using Graphics in C and Automatically sync with the System Date and Time
  
# Description:

  This Mini Project in C is used to give current cpu time the program will show the exact time,date,month and year in the graphical format 
  
# Requirements:

	Operating System that supports execution of C-Program.

	A suitable IDE of C program that accepts data (Code Blocks is used).

	Header Files Required: 

	● <graphics.h> (graphics header) : It initializes the graphics system by loading the passed graphics driver then changing the system into graphics mode. 
									   It also resets or initializes all graphics settings like color, palette, current position etc, to their default values. 

	● <stdio.h> (Standard input-output header) : Used to perform input and output operations in C. 

	● <stdlib.h> (Standard library header) : Perform standard utility functions.

	● <time.h> (Date and Time Functions) : Perform functions related to date and time. To modify the system date and get the CPU time respectively.

	● <conio.h> (console input/output) : Perform console input and console output operations. To get the character from the keyboard.
	
# Test Plan:

	Based  on the current cpu time the program will show the exact time,date,month and year in the graphical format 

# Test Cases:

	Test cases for this Digital Clock are Not Available.Because it takes the current system time and date and show in Graphical Format

	And the Time and Date are Automatically updated using the time functions
	
# Expected Results:

	On Successful Execution of Src file The System Produces Date and Time in Graphical Format
