# Digital Clock
The system that is anticipated to be built consists of a 6 digit clock including hour, minute and second using a very cheap devices that covers a very favorable place. 
	
  The design consists of all the features that a digital clock should consist and as the design is synchronous the overall delay is negligible.
	
  In this program the clock will start with the Current Time of the System and then it will work like a digital clock where it will show the time with hour, minutes and seconds
	
	  STEP 1:Initializes hour, minute, seconds with System Time
		
	  STEP 2:Run an infinite loop.Similarly with Days ,Months and Years
